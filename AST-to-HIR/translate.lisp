;;; When we translate a GO-WITH-VARIABLE-AST to an UNWIND-INSTRUCTION,
;;; the target instruction does not necessarily exist yet.  So in the
;;; SUCCESSORS slot of the UNWIND-INSTRUCTION, we store the contents
;;; of the INDEX slot of the AST and a vector created when the
;;; TAGBODY-WITH-VARIABLE-AST is translated.  We must then fix up
;;; those UNWIND-INSTRUCTIONs by replacing the SUCCESSORS slot by the
;;; instruction in the vector at the location of the index.  This
;;; variable holds the list of UNWIND-INSTRUCTIONs to fix up.
