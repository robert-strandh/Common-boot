;;; This function takes an ENTER-INSTRUCTION and finds the longest
;;; simple path from the enter instruction.  The algorithm is probably
;;; not very efficient, but we count on our graphs not to be very
;;; complex, so it should be fine.
;;;
;;; We simply do a depth first search from the ENTER-INSTRUCTION.  For
;;; each successor of some instruction, we do a recursive depth-first
;;; search for each successor and compare the lengths of the paths
;;; that each search generates.
