@chapter Nodes of a control-flow graph

@section Data nodes

There are two kinds of data nodes in a @cfg{}; @emph{literals} and
@emph{registers}.  In figures illustrating some part of a @cfg{}, a
data node is drawn using an oval shape.  A literal can be the input of
one or more instructions, and it corresponds to a @commonlisp{}
object.  A register can be the input or the output of one or more
instructions.

@section Instruction nodes

An instruction node corresponds to some kind of action, typically
taking one or more inputs and generating one or more outputs.  An
instruction node can have @math{0}, @math{1}, or @math{2} successors,
depending on the type of the node.  Node types with @math{0}
successors correspond to instructions with some non-local control
transfer such as @code{return} or @code{unwind}.  In figures
illustrating some parts of a @cfg{}, an instruction node is drawn
using a rectangular shape.
